### 🤷 Why?
Because I was tired of having to write extremely long `mogrify` commands by hand.

### ⬇️ Requirements
* Having [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install) installed on your computer.
* Having [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) installed on your computer.

### ⚙️ How to use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Run `npm run dev` in your terminal.
4. Enter the sizes you want your images to be resized to, the input and output paths.
5. Click on the "Create command" button.
6. Paste the command in your terminal.
7. Enjoy your resized images 😎.
