### 🤷 Why?
Because I was tired of having to write extremely long `convert` commands by hand.

### ⬇️ Requirements
* Having [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install) installed on your computer.
* Having [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) installed on your computer.

### ⚙️ How to use
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. `cd` into the correct directory.
3. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
4. Run `npm run dev` in your terminal.
5. Fill in as many forms as you need.
6. Click on the "Create command" button.
7. Paste the command in your terminal.
8. Enjoy your resized images 😎.

### 💡 Infos
* Don't forget to add `/*[file extension]` at the end of your input directory.
* I know the design is meh, but I didn't have time to do a better job.
* Feel free to modify the source code to suit your needs.

### ✨ Coming soon
* Possibility to choose if you want to keep the aspect ratio or not.
